# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

As part of the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The app uses the Day.js library to display the day/date and adjust how each hour is visually presented based on whether it is past, present, or future. 

While completing this project, I referenced materials from the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, MDN Web Docs, and W3Schools.
